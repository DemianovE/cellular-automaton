# Cellular Automaton
This is a small JavaFX project to implement a game like cellular automaton simulation.
THis project is a simple runner. It is implemented with the UI based on singleton UI
classes and the Game Engine class which is calculating actual epochs. As the game is 
local, the classes inside are all singleton.

## Description
The project is created to make visual simulation of the cellular automaton with possibility 
of configurations. The code is utilizing several types of the neighborhoods. This is a 
theoretical project.

Neighborhoods:
 - **Van Neumann** — cross around live cell
 - **Van Neumann extended** — extended cross around cell
 - **Moore** — square of blocks around live cell
